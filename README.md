BankCat Mockup Website

This is a website that I designed in HTML, CSS, and Javascript with inspiration from content at www.dribbble.com. The website is a Banking website with some working functionality included in the JS file. As of right now, the website is supported for Full Screen and Mobile viewing only. Mid-view (ie - iPad or similar sized windows) may provide some bugs or strange looking layouts. 

I hope you enjoy.
